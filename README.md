# DATA 603 Platforms for Big Data Processing

## Big Data with example and types
Big Data refers to the very large amount of data which is very difficult to handle with regular data processing practices because of its volumetirc, variety and high frequency challenges. It took its pace in the year 2005 and since then every industry dealing with the data has been using big data technologies. Starting from comments on social networking platforms to satellite launch, we are using big data everywhere.

There are three type in Big Data:
- Structured Data: Data which is organised in the form of tabels or databases.
- Unstructured Data: Data which don't follow any schema or a predefined structure.
- Semi-Structured Data: Data which has no definite scheme but still maintains a loose structure.

## 6 ‘V’s of Big Data
The 6 V's in big data describes the characterstics of it. They are:

- Volume: The quantity of data produced or required for processing. In one minute, YouTube processes more than 500 hours of video.
- Velocity: The rate at which data must be processed after it has been generated. Data from high-frequency stock trading.
- Variety: The range of data sources and data types. Using text, visuals, and sensor data together in autonomous cars.
- Veracity: The reliability and accuracy of the data. Detecting fake news in social media streams.
- Value: Getting valuable information and insights from data. An example would be customized product recommendations in online shopping.
- Visibility: The capacity to gain real-time access to and analysis of data. An illustration would be cybersecurity network traffic monitoring.
