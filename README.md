# DATA 603 Platforms for Big Data Processing

## Big Data with example and types
Big Data refers to the very large amount of data which is very difficult to handle with regular data processing practices because of its volumetirc, variety and high frequency challenges. It took its pace in the year 2005 and since then every industry dealing with the data has been using big data technologies. Starting from comments on social networking platforms to satellite launch, we are using big data everywhere.

There are three type in Big Data:
- Structured Data: Data which is organised in the form of tabels or databases.
- Unstructured Data: Data which don't follow any schema or a predefined structure.
- Semi-Structured Data: Data which has no definite scheme but still maintains a loose structure.

## 6 ‘V’s of Big Data
The 6 V's in big data describes the characterstics of it.

- Volume: The quantity of data produced or required for processing. In one minute, YouTube processes more than 500 hours of video.
- Velocity: The rate at which data must be processed after it has been generated. Data from high-frequency stock trading.
- Variety: The range of data sources and data types. Using text, visuals, and sensor data together in autonomous cars.
- Veracity: The reliability and accuracy of the data. Detecting fake news in social media streams.
- Value: Getting valuable information and insights from data. An example would be customized product recommendations in online shopping.
- Visibility: The capacity to gain real-time access to and analysis of data. An illustration would be cybersecurity network traffic monitoring.

## Phases of Big Data analysis
In general there are six phases in big data analysis

- Data Collection: Gathering data from multiple sources, such as sensors, databases, and external APIs.
- Data preprocessing: It is the process of preparing raw data for analysis by cleaning, converting, and handling missing values and outliers.
- Data storage: The process of effectively storing data, frequently using Hadoop or other distributed systems or cloud-based storage options.
- Data Analysis: Applying statistical, machine learning, or deep learning methods to reveal patterns and useful insights which helps in making business decisions.
- Data visualization: Using graphs, charts, and dashboards to visually represent the findings.
- Data interpretation: Using the analysis to reach judgments and make decisions.


## Challenges in Big Data analysis
Being a game changer in its feild it has some of the cons that can't be hidden nor can't be avoided such as,

- Volume: Managing and storing enormous amounts of data can be expensive and time-consuming.
- Velocity: Quick systems and effective algorithms are needed for real-time data processing.
- Variety: Integrating several data types might be difficult, and older tools might not be able to handle them.
- Veracity: Ensuring data quality and addressing sources of noisy or doubtful data.
- Value: Finding important insights in the midst of Big Data's complexity and noise.
- Protecting sensitive data and adhering to laws like the GDPR are two aspects of privacy and security.
