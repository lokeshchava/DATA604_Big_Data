# DATA 603 Platforms for Big Data Processing

## Big Data with example and types
Big Data refers to the very large amount of data which is very difficult to handle with regular data processing practices because of its volumetirc, variety and high frequency challenges. It took its pace in the year 2005 and since then every industry dealing with the data has been using big data technologies. Starting from comments on social networking platforms to satellite launch, we are using big data everywhere.

There are three type in Big Data:
- Structured Data: Data which is organised in the form of tabels or databases.
- Unstructured Data: Data which don't follow any schema or a predefined structure.
- Semi-Structured Data: Data which has no definite scheme but still maintains a loose structure.

## 6 ‘V’s of Big Data
The 6 V's in big data describes the characterstics of it. They are:

- Volume: The sheer amount of data generated. Example: YouTube processes over 500 hours of video per minute.
- Velocity: The speed at which data is generated and must be processed. Example: High-frequency stock trading data.
- Variety: The diversity of data types and sources. Example: Combining text, images, and sensor data in autonomous vehicles.
- Veracity: The trustworthiness and quality of data. Example: Detecting fake news in social media streams.
- Value: Extracting meaningful insights and value from data. Example: Personalized product recommendations in e-commerce.
- Visibility: The ability to access and analyze data in real-time. Example: Monitoring network traffic for cybersecurity.
